/*

ENUM, SET. Data Type is a predifiend set of values.
you input should be in the list else it will not store that value.

Set is same like ENUM. But it can accept multiple values at a time.

ENUM('first', 'second', 'third') -> it accept only one value -> first|second|third
SET('first', 'second', 'third') -> It accepts mutiple -> first, second.
INDEX (col_name1, col_name2)
Primary Key (col_name);

/*
CHAR vs VARCHAR.
CHAR data type is used to store fixed-length string data and the VARCHAR data type is used to store variable-length string data.
The storage size of the CHAR data type will always be the maximum length of this data type and the storage size of VARCHAR will be the length of the inserted string data. Hence, it is better to use the CHAR data type when the length of the string will be the same length for all the records.
CHAR is used to store small data whereas VARCHAR is used to store large data.
CHAR works faster and VARCHAR works slower.

/*
Date type.
A TIMESTAMP data type is used to store the combination of date and time value 
which is 19 characters long.
